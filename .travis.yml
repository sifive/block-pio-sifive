# The following is a high level description of the build, since there are a
# number of moving pieces, including juggling multiple Docker images and mounted
# volumes.
#
# 1. Run Wit (in the Wit Docker container) to fetch packages and set up
#    workspace. The workspace is initialized in on the host at $WIT_WORKSPACE.
#    This Git repository is also mounted into the Docker container so that Wit
#    can clone from the repository that Travis CI already cloned instead of
#    cloning from the web again.
# 2. Run Wake commands (in the blockci Docker container) with $WIT_WORKSPACE
#    mounted inside to actually run CI checks.
